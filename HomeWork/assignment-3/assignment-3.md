**P1.**<br>
a. Source: 33000; Dest: 80.<br>
b. Source: 80; Dest: 33000.<br>
c. Yes.<br>
d. No.<br>
<br>
**P3.**<br>
a. 01010011 + 01100110 = 10111001 and 10111001 + 01110100 = 00101110, so that the 1's complement is
11010001<br>
b. We see that recever will add those bytes in order to check the sum. And there will be an erro if
the result contains 0, which shows that 1-bit error will be detected and 2-bit might be undetected.<br>
<br>
**P15.**<br>
n = 15<br>
<br>
**P37.**<br>
a.<br>
For GBN: A sends 1,2,3,4,5,2,3,4,5 and B sends 1,1,1,1,2,3,4,5.<br>
For SR:  A sends 1,2,3,4,5,2 and B sends 1,3,4,5,2.<br>
For TCP: A sends 1,2,3,4,5,2 and B sends 2,2,2,2,6.<br>
<br>

b. [6, 16] and [17, 22].<br>
c. Detected by a triple duplicated ACK.<br>
d. Detected by a timeout.<br>

i. 4 and 7.<br>
j. 21 and 4.<br>
